Design Bible

-Take advantage of the camera skew system to create interesting optical illusions in your level design.
-Don't combine horizontal camera skew with yaw unless you have a very good reason. The effect is sickening.
-Camera skew transitions should be reasonably short and sharp, else you risk disorienting the player.
