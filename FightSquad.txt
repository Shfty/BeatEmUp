The Beat 'Em Up version of the A-Team

4 members
	Ezra
	The Warrior
		Female
		Older
			60s
			'Grammy 76' vibe, think Bernie from Gears of War 3
			Grey hair
			Dreads
		Chewing on a cocktail stick
			Quit smoking a while back
		Takes no shit
			That one bit of Mugen giving the aggressive glance in the Samurai Champloo intro
			Pipe to the face first, questions second
		Elements of Garou-era Terry Bogard
			Acts as a streetwise mentor to the post-mage
		Shades
			On forehead 99% of the time
			Drop over eyes for comedic purposes when knocked over
		Small gold ring earring in left ear
		RE4 Bomber Jacket
		Blue-grey Jeans
		Wields a lead pipe like Guts wields a greatsword
			Medium sized weapon with a shitload of brute force behind it
			Takes up a loadout slot, always slotted
			Stab it into the ground while you idle like a cool samurai
			Home Run
				Launch an enemy offscreen, have them fly around the planet and come back in from the other side
			Round Trip
				Needs way more impact than your standard round trip
		Backdash 'hero landing slide' dodge
		Forward lunge
			Homing
			'Get me up in their face right now' move
			Aerial ninja gaiden wind path variant
		Prefers a motorbike
			Character-exclusive loadout item
			"I don't care if you think it's impractical."
			Fast
				Very fast
					Will wreck if crashed
						Automatic backflip to safety
						You won't crash if you're good though
			Powerslide
				Into handlebar grab smash-you-in-the-face-with-a-motorbike front flip
			Scrape pipe along the ground just to look stylish
		Backstory
			Very weak Nv attunement
				Can see flashes of it
				Unable to coerce it
				Used to be fully magic-attuned in her past life
					Was a powerful battlemage
						Wielded a greatsword
							'Foehammer'
								"Who would name a greatsword 'Foehammer'?"
									"You don't need a keen edge when you have magic."
						Wielded a silver revolver
						50/50 Valkyrie/Gunslinger
						Used to travel via ground-level flight magic instead of a motorcycle
				Regains it toward the end of the Second Era
					Emblazons wings and "Golden Age" on the back of her jacket
					Calls it "the old fire"
					Old magic being channeled through Nv
						Different appearance, polygonal fire
					Also gets a big-ass shotgun slug revolver to mark the return of her memories
						"Justice (De Schaine Firearms)" engraved on barrel
			Reincarnated soul from before god left the world
				Stranded in limbo, was unable to pass on
				God's return 'rebooted' all the stranded souls
			No-shit personality is a side-effect of being unable to pass on
				Not revealed in this game, food for thought
					Hinted at in endgame dialogue & cutscene
						"Old Warrior."
							"So I've been around a long time. Doesn't make a difference."
								"You've been around for far longer than you seem to think"
									[Pipe to the face] "What did you just say to me?"
										"A lifetime, one might say" [Dodge back, wipe blood from mouth, final boss begins]
						Lights up a cigarette in the post-game after riding her bike out of the city to think on what's happened
							Regaining scraps of memory from just under the surface
								Character select magic attunement meter should occasionally glitch out to above max in the post-game
				A restless soul
				Not necessarily aware of it yet
					Beats up god with the lead pipe at the end of the Third Age
						"You left and stranded us all in limbo for centuries. I'm here to show you that there's no such thing as being above consequences."
						Doesn't -kill- god, beats up
							Subvert the trope
							God needs to live for magic to remain, and for souls to pass on
							Magic ends up being taken from god and disseminated throughout the world
								Humanity can manage on its own
								God can keep an eye on 'the outside' (the rest of the universe)
							Doesn't pass on until her second death
								Sticks it out until the end when given the choice
								Feels the need to keep an eye on humanity after all she's seen
									Ushering in a new age
								"Me? I'm staying to face the consequences. I'll go when it happens naturally."
									Dies of natural causes at a ripe old age in the Third Era
										After a few years of using the lead pipe as a walking stick
										Still pretty badass up til the end

			Special input to cash out for a reality-bending super
			Empties if you let an enemy escape
		Rustles so hard he can spin the world around him
			Not Nv attuned, but reality is malleable following the return of magic and he's real strong
